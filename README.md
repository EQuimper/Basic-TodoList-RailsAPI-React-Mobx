This is a test for me to understand how use React and Rails API-only + MobX.

Basic todo list with completed checkbox.

For running:

- Go in the ApiTest folder and run `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`
- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:seed`
- `rails s`

After this go in the folder ApiTestFrontEnd

* `npm i`
* `npm start`

You need to have the front end a `localhost:3001` so just `y` when they ask you for a other port
